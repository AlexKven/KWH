adjust sim server to respond with the modem response
This way I can check each response message as needed instead of having
to write all responses to a log file

Once that's done analyze server response and time stamp in a file
to look for missing time stamps

Maybe add csq to list and record that and limited bytes of other necessary
info to analyze whether the lost packet was due to reception or an issue
with timing communication to the sim

Finish pulse code to launch configured channels on boot

Consider schmit trigger or other safety

start testing modbus

start testing temp sensors

investigate parsing smsRead and building inital SMS configurability

Improve getTime logic to be more selective and properly acquire the 32 time bits.

Add log cycling service to prevent filling the SD card, but still allow
simple logging via DEBUG conf

figure out conf reload for all code that starts at boot and won't know
about updated ENV variables from SMS commands

setup SMS request for DEBUG and each log file so we can query logs remotely

setup simServer to test SIM coms and reset when necessary
